# Basic Discord Bot

A basic discord bot in JavaScript, with a few commands. This project gave me experience with JavaScript, bot creation, Visual Studio Code, and discord. Must change bot token before implementing.

## Commands:

Responds to a "!help" command, a "!multiply" command, and a "!bing" command.

### !help:
Type "!help [topic]" in the chat box and the bot will reply "you need help with [topic]".

### !multiply:
Type "!multiply [number] [number]" in the chat box and the bot will return the product.

### !bing:
Type "!bing" in the chat box and the bot will respond with "bong".
